# R interface to Google Gemini API

Functions to use Gemini from R. In development. Currently supports:

- Basic prompts
- JSON output also with structured response
- Upload of images, pdf and other documents

See examples below.

# Installation

Best install from r-universe:

```r
install.packages('rgemini', repos = c('https://skranz.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Otherwise try to install directly from Github:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) { install.packages("remotes") }
remotes::install_github("skranz/rgemini") 
```

# Examples


## 1. Set API key and Basic prompt

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rgemini)
set_gemini_api_key(file = "~/repbox/gemini/gemini_api_key.txt")
```

Load library and specify API key.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(rgemini)
set_gemini_api_key("<YOUR GEMINI API KEY>")
```

A simple prompt.
```{r}
run_gemini("Tell a joke.")
```

Return more details of Gemini API response.

```{r}
details = run_gemini("Tell a joke.",detailed_results = TRUE)
# str(details)
```

The returned `details` are a large list with all sort of information.

## 2. JSON mode

```{r}
run_gemini("Tell 2 jokes. Return JSON with fields 'topic' and 'joke'.",json_mode = TRUE)
```


# 3. JSON mode with a response schema

The Gemini API also allows to provide JSON response schemas (see https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step) for better guarantees that your JSON output satisfies a desired structure.

`rgemini` has small helper functions `arr_resp`, `obj_resp` and `response_schema` to build simple json schemas from an example. 

```{r}
prompt = "List 3 asian countries, their capital, the most famous building and the countries' inhabitants in million."

# Creates a schema from an example
schema = response_schema(arr_resp(obj_resp(capital = "Paris", country="France", famous_building="Eiffel Tower", population = 60.1)))

run_gemini(prompt = prompt,response_schema = schema)
```

Here is a more comples nested schema. Will return nested tibbles.

```{r}
prompt = "Show info for one african country, its capital with name and population in mio, the most famous building and inhabitants in million. Add three facts about the country."

# obj_resp expects to return a single object
# arr_resp expected a list of objects
# Both can be nested
schema = response_schema(obj_resp(
  capital = obj_resp(capital="Paris", cap_pop=5),
  country="France", famous_building="Eiffel Tower",
  population = 60.2,
  facts = arr_resp(obj_resp(factno=1L, name="fact1", descr="fact_description"))
))

# For this schema run_gemini currently
# returns a list (obj_resp) or data frame (arr_resp) with nested data frames
res = run_gemini(prompt = prompt,response_schema = schema)
str(res)
```


Two things to note:

- From my experience with larger tasks providing a schema does not always improve things, I often got better output without a schema. But that might change.

- I am currently building the package `DataSchema` (https://github.com/skranz/DataSchema) that will allow more complex schema specifications.


## 4. Use an image

That is the image we upload:

![image](word_img.png)


```{r}
img_file = paste0("~/repbox/gemini/word_img.png")
media <- gemini_media_upload(img_file)
run_gemini("Please write down all words you can detect in the image.", media=media)
```


## 5. Use a PDF and an Image

```{r}
files = c("~/repbox/gemini/word_img.png", "~/repbox/gemini/colors_pdf.pdf")
media <- gemini_media_upload(files)
run_gemini("Please write down all words you can detect in the uploaded pdf and image.", media=media)

```

## 6. Context caching

The gemini API also allows context caching (see https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching). Context caching can e.g. be helpful if you have repeated prompts to the same large PDF document (or a set of PDF documents). 

To use context caching you can generate a context object with `gemini_context` and pass it to `gemini_run`. I have not yet made a nice example for this README though.

## 7. Get information about available gemini models

Use a `gemini_list_models()` function to get a data frame with information about all available models at the Gemini API. 

```{r}
gemini_list_models() %>% 
  filter(startsWith(displayName, "Gemini 2"))
```
